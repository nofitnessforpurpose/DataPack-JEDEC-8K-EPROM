  Data Packs trypically reside in <a  targer="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nofitnessforpurpose/DataPak">side slot housings</a? though the circuit is also applicable to the devices Top Slot interface. The circuit presents a Linear mode addressing scheme (though note the effevtive addressing resulting from the pin roouting).   <br>
  
  The default repository format for 3D files is STEP (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303"> ISO 10303</a> ) due to its high fidelity.  { STL files are surface geometry as opposed to solid model representations, often containing export processing artifacts }. 
<br>  
  The default repository format for PCB files is <a targer="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_format">GERBER</a> .
<br>

<br>  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.freecad.org/" > FreeCAD </a> may prove suitable for viewing, handling and, if desired modifying STEP files.
<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.kicad.org/" >KiCad </a> may prove suitable for viewing GERBER files.

## Considerations
3D model(s) makes no accomodation for manufacturing tolerances, process or material - see Notes below.  
The PCB is currently beta and has not been tested, it remains your responsiblity to asses suitability!

## Questions / Discussion
See <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.organiser2.com/"> Organiser 2 Hardware </a> forum, though see note below first.
